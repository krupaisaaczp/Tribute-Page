            <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is best known in popular culture for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc², which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".</p>
            <p>Born in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire on 14 March 1879, Einstein studied at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich. In 1905, he published four groundbreaking papers that established him as one of the leading scientists of his time.</p>
